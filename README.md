# What is this?
You've perhaps curiously stumbled onto this page and you are confused as to what exactly you are looking at. Never fear, for this guide will take you through the process of learning the ins and outs of this project. First and foremost, POSS (Project Open Source Story) is aimed at creating a collection of writing from all across the globe, and hopefully in the end will result in a formidable collection of high quality short stories to be released as volumes online, for all to enjoy!

If you are a writer interested in positive feedback, a reader looking for a new and interesting way to consume the art, or an editor looking to hone your skills, this is the place for you!

# Latest Download
There's nothing here yet, but hopefully soon there will be! Once we begin getting complete works, we will be compiling them together into .pdf files as full volumes to be released for free for all to read! Look forward to it!

## Still want to read?
You can browse through the folders of all the branches of this project to see what everyone is up to, which means you have full access to everyone's current works at any given time!

There are multiple ways you can contribute to the project, and we are always looking for more hopefuls interested in joining us! There exist three ways to contribute documentation to the project at the moment!

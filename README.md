# Welcome!
Are you interested in contributing to this project? Feel free to jump right in! Keep in mind all the Legal Stuff listed below.

# What is this?
You've perhaps curiously stumbled onto this page and you are confused as to what exactly you are looking at. Never fear, for this guide will take you through the process of learning the ins and outs of this project. First and foremost, POSS (Project Open Source Story) is aimed at creating a collection of writing from all across the globe, and hopefully in the end will result in a formidable collection of high quality short stories to be released as volumes online, for all to enjoy!

If you are a writer interested in positive feedback, a reader looking for a new and interesting way to consume the art, or an editor looking to hone your skills, this is the place for you!

# Latest Download
There's nothing here yet, but hopefully soon there will be! Once we begin getting complete works, we will be compiling them together into .pdf files as full volumes to be released for free for all to read! Look forward to it!

## Still want to read?
You can browse through the folders of all the branches of this project to see what everyone is up to, which means you have full access to everyone's current works at any given time!

# Contributing
There are multiple ways you can contribute to the project, and we are always looking for more hopefuls interested in joining us! There exist three ways to contribute documentation to the project at the moment!

## Submitting
This is the first and most obvious way. Submitting a writing to POSS is a multi step process, and can be a bit intimidating for anyone new to the project. This guide will take you through it step by step.

### Step 1: Read!
First and foremost, go through [Github's guides on using Git](https://guides.github.com/) and check out the guide on how to do [Forks and Pull Requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). (You can skip the steps involving cloning the project to your local computer, you can use Githubs' in website editor since all we will work on is text)

### Step 2: Fork!
Once you successfully fork the project into your own account, you can make your story! In the folder labeled Stories you'll find a list of all stories ever made here and posted. Take a look through these to get an idea of how other Authors do their work and organize themselves, **but do not edit any of these files!** If you do so, your project will get a Merge Conflict when you try and submit it and you'll probably get denied your submission.

### Step 3: Create!
In the Stories folder, create a new folder with the name of your story. This will be your spot to work! You can do whatever you want inside your story's folder, but if you want it to get successfully accepted when submitted, there will be several things you need to do to get accepted.

To do this, click the 'Create new file' button to start making a file in the Stories folder. Then, in the box that says 'Name your file...' start typing the title of your document, followed by a '/', which will create the folder. Next type the name of the first file for your story itself, "Chapter 1" for example. Finally add a '.md' to the end.

So if you were making a story called "MyStory", you'd type "MyStory/Chapter 1.md"

There you go, now you can begin! You can save your document by scrolling to the bottom and filling out the form for your commit (no need to be terribly verbose here, what you type here just lets you keep track of your commits) and hit the "Commit new file" button!

### Editting a saved file
To edit a saved file, open it up in github (you'll now see your folder you made) and click on the name of the file. Now you'll be able to see it, but to actually edit you'll need to click on the small pencil icon in the top right of the window. This will bring you back to the editting page. Follow the same process as as creating a new file, except this time the button at the bottom says "Commit change" instead of "Commit new file"

### Step 4: Rules!
First off, the first page of your document **must** have, and **only** have, the following text put onto it:


    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

This is the [GNU Free Documentation License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html) and must be on your document to get accepted.

**Make sure you replace 'YEAR' and 'YOUR NAME' with the current year of writing and your full name!**

Second, your Story must start on page 2 of the document, and must start off with a Title. Styling outside of this is up to you however. If editting through the GitHub website, just add a decent amount of new lines after the License before starting.

**All Documents must be written in Times New Roman**

**All Documents must use 12 point font**

**All Documents must be double spaced**

**All stories must have a file called 'README.md' in their folder. Copy the 'Template.md' file from the root and rename it to 'Readme.md', and fill out all of its information.

### Step 5: Get reviewed!
Once you feel like you have successfully completed your story and are ready to show it to the world (and are 100% certain you never editted anyone else's documents) follow the github guide on [forking and issuing pull requests](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and Issue a Pull Request! For your Pull Request's info, copy the 'Pull Request Template' document located in the root folder, and fill in all the information there. (This should be the exact same as your README.md file in your folder, so you can just copy that)

That's not the end of it yet though! To get accepted, your document will also need to satisfy the following criteria:

**First and foremost, all accepted documents must be legibly written and without grammatical and/or spelling errors!**

**Second, all documents must have content rated less than or equal to Teen Fiction, with respect to Canada/United States laws. This is a more flexible ruling and can be bent if the content is valid artistically, and feels required. Any distastefully adult content will not be accepted. This includes both extreme levels of gore and sexual content.**

**Third, the story must be to some degree correct. This is the most flexible of rules.**
### Note to editors: What does 'correct' mean?
'Correct' does **not** mean 'good to read for me'. Correct simply means the actions taken in the story follow its own written rules. A character doing something you don't enjoy or events aspiring that seem odd do not constitute incorrectness. However, if a character writes a very specific rule in the universe then promptly breaks it in their own writing, this does constitute being incorrect.

Example: Jenny is a character described as having a peanut allergy. Later Jenny eats a peanut butter sandwich and nothing happens, including the fact that Jenny seems content eating a sandwich she is allergic too, and the event is not addressed as odd or out of place. This would be something to point out and mention.

Not an example: A character displays Mary Sue like traits and seems distastefully overpowered. This is not enough to warrant denial of merge.

### Step 6: Back to the drawing board
After you see some comments on your submission, update them in your project and you'll see the changes reflected. Make sure you comment something like 'Fixed!' in response to their comment to signify you saw their comment and handled it.

### Step 7: Success!
Once the Lead Editors (me being one of them) agree your submission is ready, we will accept it into our files. Do note you can continue editting your file even after submission, and after you are done with your updates you can submit a new pull request to get it updated!

##Editting
If you are interested in supporting the project but don't feel up to the challenge of writing, POSS is always looking for editors! 

###Step one: Check out a story!
If you are interested in doing editting, simply scroll up and click on the "Pull Requests" tab at the top of the project.

Inside you'll find a list of all currently submitted stories for you to browse. To examine a specific one, just click on it. Now to see their story, click the 'Files Changed' tab to see what they have made.

###Step two: Add comments on their work!
See something out of place, a grammatical error, or a typo? On the offending line you will see a blue cross appear when you hover over it. Click the blue cross to add a comment to that line that the user will see. Viola'! You've successfully made your first editor's comment! Thanks for the help!

###Step three: Become a lead editor?
We here at POSS will keep an eye on who has been helping a lot with editting, and if we feel you are a hard worker we'll extend an invitation to you to become a lead editor. Lead editors are the individuals that get to choose whether to deny or accept Pull Requests and have access to editting the core files of the project (including templates and this readme file!)

You're welcome to decline the offer though, we won't be mad. Once extended though it's always an open offer, so if you want to try it out, we're always interested!

##Modifying
This is the core to what makes POSS special as a story project. Instead of writing your own story, you are also completely welcome to change, modify, and update any currently existing stories as well. Simply follow all of the steps listed above in creating a story, but instead of creating a new folder, go into the folder of the story you wish to edit and... edit away!

That's right, as all submissions in POSS are under the GNU Free Documentation License, users are free and welcome to edit as they please! However, a few special rules apply:

###Rule number one: Any attempts to destory or ruin the document will not be accepted as a merge. You will be denied.

###Rule number two: You may only edit one story at a time. If you wish to edit a second story, make an entire new second fork for that one. Any given branch should only ever have a single story editted in it. Submissions with multiple stories editted will be denied.

###Rule number two: You cannot modify the GNU license in the original story. Instead, add a new line just below the license with the text "Editted by YOURNAME YEAR", if some of these already exist, just add yours beneath it.

If for some reason enough of these edits exist that cause the GNU license to enter the second page, the license can be simplifed to amalgamate the names by year. This will be at the discretion of the Lead Editors.

###Rule number three: All editting rules for text formatting in submitting stories still apply.

###"what if I don't want people to be able to edit my work?"
Unfortunately this is not in the spirit of the POSS. Everything in the project is free game and, as long as the edits pass and are considered in the spirit of the original work, they can be accepted.

##Tips
###Organization
When compiled into the pdf, your folder will have all its contents compressed into one pdf file. This means you can seperate your chapters into a file each or however you please! It should be noted the files will be compressed together in alphabetical order. To gaurentee the order is correct, make sure you label your files starting with a number.

Furthermore, if your numbers extend to 10 or more, alphabetically '10' may come before '1' sometimes. To prevent this, prepend your numbers with all their spaces.

For example, instead of name your files '1' '2' '3'....'11' '12'...etc, instead go with '01' '02' '03' ...'11' '12'
Doing so will always keep your files in the correct order.

###Editting on your computer locally
Github's primary purpose is to allow you to 'clone' repos onto your computer and edit them anywhere. This is especially useful as the Git commit system lets you save your work easily and revert changes as well. To learn how to clone a repo and perform submissions from your desktop, check out the guide [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and download Github Desktop [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
